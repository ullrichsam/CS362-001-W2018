\f0\b0 \cf0 1. All appointment strings where returned as \'91null\'92\
Appt.java the method toString() has an \'91if\'92 statement that returns null\
I was able to identify this issue by first running the Calender application. I also was able to observe the cause in test05 of ApptTest.java assertEquals() line 149 and 153\
\
(I had to fix the above bug to trance down other issue because most of the returned data was \'91null\'92.)\
\
2. \'91am\'92 and \'91pm\'92 where mismatched \
Appt.java the method represntationApp () was returning \'91am\'92 for times after 11 hours. \
Identified by in test05 of ApptTest.java assertEquals() line 149 and 153 \
\
Other issues not identified:\
CalDayTest, test01 line 48. Was returning a \'913\'92 for month instead of \'9112\'92\
